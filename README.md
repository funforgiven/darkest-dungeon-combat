# Darkest Dungeon Combat
- School project made for our CMP1002 class in Bahcesehir University.
- It is made using C++ and has no graphical interface other than the colored console outputs.

## Outline
In this project, we were expected to write a program in C++ that simulates the fundamental aspects of the combat of
the game Darkest Dungeon by Red Hook Studios.

## Combat
- In a combat, up to 4 heroes (hero team) fight with up to 4 monsters (monster team) in a turn-based fashion. 
- The combat is divided into discrete rounds, and in each round, each hero and monster have a single turn where he/she uses one skill. 
- The combat lasts until either all heroes in the hero team dies or all monsters in the monster team dies.
